✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Before you start

To start development this app, you need to install the dependencies, using the following command:

```
pnpm install
```

## Running tasks

To run app in development mode use the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
pnpm nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
pnpm nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Explore the project graph

Run `pnpm nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

- [Learn more about Exploring the Project Graph](https://nx.dev/core-features/explore-graph)

To show the projects in workspace use the following command:

```
pnpm nx show projects
```

## Nx plugins and code generators (optional)

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
pnpm nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
pnpm nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
pnpm nx serve demo

# View project details
pnpm nx show project demo --web
```

Run `pnpm nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `pnpm nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

> **Note:** You can also use `pnpm nx g` as a shorthand for `pnpm nx generate`.

> **Note:** After deleting a plugin, you may need to run `pnpm install` to remove the plugin from the workspace. Also delete the plugin path from the `tsconfig.base.json` file, in compilerOptions/paths.
